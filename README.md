### A simple game project created to practice game-development concepts. It includes source code, basic assets, and brief instructions to build and run the game. See the sections below for setup, usage, and contribution notes.

### Features
- Minimal playable prototype demonstrating input, collision, and scoring.
- Small set of reusable assets (sprites, sounds).
- Clear project structure to explore game systems.

### Requirements
- A recent version of the chosen game engine or runtime (see engine-specific notes).
- A C/C#/JavaScript/TypeScript runtime or compiler as used by the project.
- Optional: an IDE or editor with debugging support.

### Setup
1. Clone or copy the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your engine/editor.
3. Install dependencies (if any), e.g. package manager or engine package import.

### Build & Run
- Run in editor: open the main scene and press Play.
- From command line: follow engine-specific build commands (see engine docs).
- For exports, use the engine's export/publish tools to create standalone builds.

### Controls
- Keyboard: arrow keys or WASD to move.
- Action: Space or left-click to interact/jump.
- See in-game help or code comments for control mapping.

### Project Structure
- src/ — game source code and scripts
- assets/ — images, audio, and fonts
- scenes/ — level or scene definitions
- docs/ — design notes and TODOs
- build/ — build outputs (ignored by VCS)

### Contributing
- Fork the repository and open a pull request for changes.
- Keep commits small and focused; include a brief description of your change.
- Add or update tests/docs when introducing new features.

### Troubleshooting
- Check console/log output for errors.
- Verify asset paths and import settings if resources fail to load.
- Consult engine documentation for platform-specific issues.

### License
- Include a short license (e.g., MIT) in LICENSE.md. Use permissive terms if sharing learning code.

### Acknowledgments
- Inspired by small game jams and learning tutorials. Contributions and improvements welcome.
